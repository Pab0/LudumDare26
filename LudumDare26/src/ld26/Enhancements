1. Make the world open, dynamically generating (and deleting) objects that are close (far) enough.
2. Show the light wave as it expands.
3. Make the lightwave more subtle while travelling through vacuum.
4. Let the light shine a little more onto a planet, revealing a tiny bit of its surface (1-10 px maybe, depending on the angle of the light source)
